    "description": "The scale of the LSST dataset means we shoudl anticipate extracting as much information out of the its catalogs as possible before turning to the pixel-level data. In this work we explore athe use of simple, low multiplicity Gaussian mixture models for realizing gravitational lens systems in LSST catalog space, to enable lboth large-scale sample simulation and direct model inference.",
